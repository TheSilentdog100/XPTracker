# XPTracker

**Note:** XPTracker is still in its early development, so bugs might occur.

## Description
XPTracker allows you to track your XP while leveling. It displays three different stats:
- **XP Gained:** The amount of XP you have gained since logging in.
- **XP Left for Level Up:** The amount of XP needed in order to level up.
- **XP Estimated per Hour:** The estimated XP per hour.
  
XPTracker also plays a sound when you level up. Currently, the sound is a German meme, so don't take it too seriously.

## Usage
- Type `/xp` to toggle the XP window on or off.
- Type `/xp lock` to lock the XP window.
- Type `/xp unlock` to unlock the XP window.
